TO-DO-LIST

Simple fullstack to-do application using NodeJS and ExpressJS for backend and React for frontend. Didn't use database. 

To start project go to parent directory, "To_Do_List" and run the following commands:
-npm install
-npm run build
-npm run dev

if you see errors during "npm run build" command, the packages are most likely depreciated but website should still work. 

If frontend doesn't automatically open in browser, go to browser and type in "http://localhost:300"
